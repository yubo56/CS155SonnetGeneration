from fairest creatures we desire increase, | that thereby beauty's rose might never die, | but as the riper should by time decease, | his tender heir might bear his memory: | but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes, | feed'st thy light's flame with self substantial fuel, | making a famine where abundance lies, | thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel: | thou that art now the world's fresh ornament, | and only herald to the gaudy spring, | within thine own bud buriest thy content, | and tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding: | pity the world, or else this glutton be, | to eat the world's due, by the grave and thee. | 
when forty winters shall besiege thy brow, | and dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field, | thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now, | will be a tattered weed of small worth held: | then being asked, where all thy beauty lies, | where all the treasure of thy lusty days; | to say within thine own deep sunken eyes, | were an all eating shame, and thriftless praise. | how much more praise deserved thy beauty's use, | if thou couldst answer 'this fair child of mine | shall sum my count, and make my old excuse' | proving his beauty by succession thine. | this were to be new made when thou art old, | and see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold. | 
look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest, | now is the time that face should form another, | whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, | thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother. | for where is she so fair whose uneared womb | disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? | or who is he so fond will be the tomb, | of his self love to stop posterity? | thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee | calls back the lovely april of her prime, | so thou through windows of thine age shalt see, | despite of wrinkles this thy golden time. | but if thou live remembered not to be, | die single and thine image dies with thee. | 
unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend, | upon thy self thy beauty's legacy? | nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend, | and being frank she lends to those are free: | then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse, | the bounteous largess given thee to give? | profitless usurer why dost thou use | so great a sum of sums yet canst not live? | for having traffic with thy self alone, | thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive, | then how when nature calls thee to be gone, | what acceptable audit canst thou leave? | thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee, | which used lives th' executor to be. | 
those hours that with gentle work did frame | the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell | will play the tyrants to the very same, | and that unfair which fairly doth excel: | for never resting time leads summer on | to hideous winter and confounds him there, | sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone, | beauty o'er snowed and bareness every where: | then were not summer's distillation left | a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass, | beauty's effect with beauty were bereft, | nor it nor no remembrance what it was. | but flowers distilled though they with winter meet, | leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet. | 
then let not winter's ragged hand deface, | in thee thy summer ere thou be distilled: | make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place, | with beauty's treasure ere it be self killed: | that use is not forbidden usury, | which happies those that pay the willing loan; | that's for thy self to breed another thee, | or ten times happier be it ten for one, | ten times thy self were happier than thou art, | if ten of thine ten times refigured thee: | then what could death do if thou shouldst depart, | leaving thee living in posterity? | be not self willed for thou art much too fair, | to be death's conquest and make worms thine heir. | 
lo in the orient when the gracious light | lifts up his burning head, each under eye | doth homage to his new appearing sight, | serving with looks his sacred majesty, | and having climbed the steep up heavenly hill, | resembling strong youth in his middle age, | yet mortal looks adore his beauty still, | attending on his golden pilgrimage: | but when from highmost pitch with weary car, | like feeble age he reeleth from the day, | the eyes (fore duteous) now converted are | from his low tract and look another way: | so thou, thy self out going in thy noon: | unlooked on diest unless thou get a son. | 
music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly? | sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy: | why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly, | or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy? | if the true concord of well tuned sounds, | by unions married do offend thine ear, | they do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds | in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear: | mark how one string sweet husband to another, | strikes each in each by mutual ordering; | resembling sire, and child, and happy mother, | who all in one, one pleasing note do sing: | whose speechless song being many, seeming one, | sings this to thee, 'thou single wilt prove none'. | 
is it for fear to wet a widow's eye, | that thou consum'st thy self in single life? | ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die, | the world will wail thee like a makeless wife, | the world will be thy widow and still weep, | that thou no form of thee hast left behind, | when every private widow well may keep, | by children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind: | look what an unthrift in the world doth spend | shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it; | but beauty's waste hath in the world an end, | and kept unused the user so destroys it: | no love toward others in that bosom sits | that on himself such murd'rous shame commits. | 
for shame deny that thou bear'st love to any | who for thy self art so unprovident. | grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many, | but that thou none lov'st is most evident: | for thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate, | that 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire, | seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate | which to repair should be thy chief desire: | o change thy thought, that i may change my mind, | shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love? | be as thy presence is gracious and kind, | or to thy self at least kind hearted prove, | make thee another self for love of me, | that beauty still may live in thine or thee. | 
as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st, | in one of thine, from that which thou departest, | and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st, | thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest, | herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase, | without this folly, age, and cold decay, | if all were minded so, the times should cease, | and threescore year would make the world away: | let those whom nature hath not made for store, | harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish: | look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more; | which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish: | she carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby, | thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die. | 
when i do count the clock that tells the time, | and see the brave day sunk in hideous night, | when i behold the violet past prime, | and sable curls all silvered o'er with white: | when lofty trees i see barren of leaves, | which erst from heat did canopy the herd | and summer's green all girded up in sheaves | borne on the bier with white and bristly beard: | then of thy beauty do i question make | that thou among the wastes of time must go, | since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake, | and die as fast as they see others grow, | and nothing 'gainst time's scythe can make defence | save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence. | 
o that you were your self, but love you are | no longer yours, than you your self here live, | against this coming end you should prepare, | and your sweet semblance to some other give. | so should that beauty which you hold in lease | find no determination, then you were | your self again after your self's decease, | when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear. | who lets so fair a house fall to decay, | which husbandry in honour might uphold, | against the stormy gusts of winter's day | and barren rage of death's eternal cold? | o none but unthrifts, dear my love you know, | you had a father, let your son say so. | 
not from the stars do i my judgement pluck, | and yet methinks i have astronomy, | but not to tell of good, or evil luck, | of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality, | nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell; | pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind, | or say with princes if it shall go well | by oft predict that i in heaven find. | but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive, | and constant stars in them i read such art | as truth and beauty shall together thrive | if from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert: | or else of thee this i prognosticate, | thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date. | 
when i consider every thing that grows | holds in perfection but a little moment. | that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows | whereon the stars in secret influence comment. | when i perceive that men as plants increase, | cheered and checked even by the self same sky: | vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease, | and wear their brave state out of memory. | then the conceit of this inconstant stay, | sets you most rich in youth before my sight, | where wasteful time debateth with decay | to change your day of youth to sullied night, | and all in war with time for love of you, | as he takes from you, i engraft you new. | 
but wherefore do not you a mightier way | make war upon this bloody tyrant time? | and fortify your self in your decay | with means more blessed than my barren rhyme? | now stand you on the top of happy hours, | and many maiden gardens yet unset, | with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers, | much liker than your painted counterfeit: | so should the lines of life that life repair | which this (time's pencil) or my pupil pen | neither in inward worth nor outward fair | can make you live your self in eyes of men. | to give away your self, keeps your self still, | and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill. | 
who will believe my verse in time to come | if it were filled with your most high deserts? | though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb | which hides your life, and shows not half your parts: | if i could write the beauty of your eyes, | and in fresh numbers number all your graces, | the age to come would say this poet lies, | such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces. | so should my papers (yellowed with their age) | be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue, | and your true rights be termed a poet's rage, | and stretched metre of an antique song. | but were some child of yours alive that time, | you should live twice in it, and in my rhyme. | 
shall i compare thee to a summer's day? | thou art more lovely and more temperate: | rough winds do shake the darling buds of may, | and summer's lease hath all too short a date: | sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, | and often is his gold complexion dimmed, | and every fair from fair sometime declines, | by chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed: | but thy eternal summer shall not fade, | nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st, | nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade, | when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st, | so long as men can breathe or eyes can see, | so long lives this, and this gives life to thee. | 
devouring time blunt thou the lion's paws, | and make the earth devour her own sweet brood, | pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws, | and burn the long lived phoenix, in her blood, | make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st, | and do whate'er thou wilt swift footed time | to the wide world and all her fading sweets: | but i forbid thee one most heinous crime, | o carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow, | nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen, | him in thy course untainted do allow, | for beauty's pattern to succeeding men. | yet do thy worst old time: despite thy wrong, | my love shall in my verse ever live young. | 
a woman's face with nature's own hand painted, | hast thou the master mistress of my passion, | a woman's gentle heart but not acquainted | with shifting change as is false women's fashion, | an eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling: | gilding the object whereupon it gazeth, | a man in hue all hues in his controlling, | which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth. | and for a woman wert thou first created, | till nature as she wrought thee fell a doting, | and by addition me of thee defeated, | by adding one thing to my purpose nothing. | but since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure, | mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure. | 
so is it not with me as with that muse, | stirred by a painted beauty to his verse, | who heaven it self for ornament doth use, | and every fair with his fair doth rehearse, | making a couplement of proud compare | with sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems: | with april's first born flowers and all things rare, | that heaven's air in this huge rondure hems. | o let me true in love but truly write, | and then believe me, my love is as fair, | as any mother's child, though not so bright | as those gold candles fixed in heaven's air: | let them say more that like of hearsay well, | i will not praise that purpose not to sell. | 
my glass shall not persuade me i am old, | so long as youth and thou are of one date, | but when in thee time's furrows i behold, | then look i death my days should expiate. | for all that beauty that doth cover thee, | is but the seemly raiment of my heart, | which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me, | how can i then be elder than thou art? | o therefore love be of thyself so wary, | as i not for my self, but for thee will, | bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary | as tender nurse her babe from faring ill. | presume not on thy heart when mine is slain, | thou gav'st me thine not to give back again. | 
as an unperfect actor on the stage, | who with his fear is put beside his part, | or some fierce thing replete with too much rage, | whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart; | so i for fear of trust, forget to say, | the perfect ceremony of love's rite, | and in mine own love's strength seem to decay, | o'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might: | o let my looks be then the eloquence, | and dumb presagers of my speaking breast, | who plead for love, and look for recompense, | more than that tongue that more hath more expressed. | o learn to read what silent love hath writ, | to hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit. | 
mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled, | thy beauty's form in table of my heart, | my body is the frame wherein 'tis held, | and perspective it is best painter's art. | for through the painter must you see his skill, | to find where your true image pictured lies, | which in my bosom's shop is hanging still, | that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes: | now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done, | mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me | are windows to my breast, where through the sun | delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee; | yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art, | they draw but what they see, know not the heart. | 
let those who are in favour with their stars, | of public honour and proud titles boast, | whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars | unlooked for joy in that i honour most; | great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread, | but as the marigold at the sun's eye, | and in themselves their pride lies buried, | for at a frown they in their glory die. | the painful warrior famoused for fight, | after a thousand victories once foiled, | is from the book of honour razed quite, | and all the rest forgot for which he toiled: | then happy i that love and am beloved | where i may not remove nor be removed. | 
lord of my love, to whom in vassalage | thy merit hath my duty strongly knit; | to thee i send this written embassage | to witness duty, not to show my wit. | duty so great, which wit so poor as mine | may make seem bare, in wanting words to show it; | but that i hope some good conceit of thine | in thy soul's thought (all naked) will bestow it: | till whatsoever star that guides my moving, | points on me graciously with fair aspect, | and puts apparel on my tattered loving, | to show me worthy of thy sweet respect, | then may i dare to boast how i do love thee, | till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me. | 
weary with toil, i haste me to my bed, | the dear respose for limbs with travel tired, | but then begins a journey in my head | to work my mind, when body's work's expired. | for then my thoughts (from far where i abide) | intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee, | and keep my drooping eyelids open wide, | looking on darkness which the blind do see. | save that my soul's imaginary sight | presents thy shadow to my sightless view, | which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night) | makes black night beauteous, and her old face new. | lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind, | for thee, and for my self, no quiet find. | 
how can i then return in happy plight | that am debarred the benefit of rest? | when day's oppression is not eased by night, | but day by night and night by day oppressed. | and each (though enemies to either's reign) | do in consent shake hands to torture me, | the one by toil, the other to complain | how far i toil, still farther off from thee. | i tell the day to please him thou art bright, | and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven: | so flatter i the swart complexioned night, | when sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even. | but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer, | and night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger | 
when in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, | i all alone beweep my outcast state, | and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, | and look upon my self and curse my fate, | wishing me like to one more rich in hope, | featured like him, like him with friends possessed, | desiring this man's art, and that man's scope, | with what i most enjoy contented least, | yet in these thoughts my self almost despising, | haply i think on thee, and then my state, | (like to the lark at break of day arising | from sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate, | for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings, | that then i scorn to change my state with kings. | 
when to the sessions of sweet silent thought, | i summon up remembrance of things past, | i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought, | and with old woes new wail my dear time's waste: | then can i drown an eye (unused to flow) | for precious friends hid in death's dateless night, | and weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe, | and moan th' expense of many a vanished sight. | then can i grieve at grievances foregone, | and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er | the sad account of fore bemoaned moan, | which i new pay as if not paid before. | but if the while i think on thee (dear friend) | all losses are restored, and sorrows end. | 
thy bosom is endeared with all hearts, | which i by lacking have supposed dead, | and there reigns love and all love's loving parts, | and all those friends which i thought buried. | how many a holy and obsequious tear | hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye, | as interest of the dead, which now appear, | but things removed that hidden in thee lie. | thou art the grave where buried love doth live, | hung with the trophies of my lovers gone, | who all their parts of me to thee did give, | that due of many, now is thine alone. | their images i loved, i view in thee, | and thou (all they) hast all the all of me. | 
if thou survive my well contented day, | when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover | and shalt by fortune once more re survey | these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover: | compare them with the bett'ring of the time, | and though they be outstripped by every pen, | reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme, | exceeded by the height of happier men. | o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought, | 'had my friend's muse grown with this growing age, | a dearer birth than this his love had brought | to march in ranks of better equipage: | but since he died and poets better prove, | theirs for their style i'll read, his for his love'. | 
full many a glorious morning have i seen, | flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye, | kissing with golden face the meadows green; | gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy: | anon permit the basest clouds to ride, | with ugly rack on his celestial face, | and from the forlorn world his visage hide | stealing unseen to west with this disgrace: | even so my sun one early morn did shine, | with all triumphant splendour on my brow, | but out alack, he was but one hour mine, | the region cloud hath masked him from me now. | yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth, | suns of the world may stain, when heaven's sun staineth. | 
why didst thou promise such a beauteous day, | and make me travel forth without my cloak, | to let base clouds o'ertake me in my way, | hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke? | 'tis not enough that through the cloud thou break, | to dry the rain on my storm beaten face, | for no man well of such a salve can speak, | that heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace: | nor can thy shame give physic to my grief, | though thou repent, yet i have still the loss, | th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief | to him that bears the strong offence's cross. | ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds, | and they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds. | 
no more be grieved at that which thou hast done, | roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud, | clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun, | and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud. | all men make faults, and even i in this, | authorizing thy trespass with compare, | my self corrupting salving thy amiss, | excusing thy sins more than thy sins are: | for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense, | thy adverse party is thy advocate, | and 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence: | such civil war is in my love and hate, | that i an accessary needs must be, | to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me. | 
let me confess that we two must be twain, | although our undivided loves are one: | so shall those blots that do with me remain, | without thy help, by me be borne alone. | in our two loves there is but one respect, | though in our lives a separable spite, | which though it alter not love's sole effect, | yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight. | i may not evermore acknowledge thee, | lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame, | nor thou with public kindness honour me, | unless thou take that honour from thy name: | but do not so, i love thee in such sort, | as thou being mine, mine is thy good report. | 
as a decrepit father takes delight, | to see his active child do deeds of youth, | so i, made lame by fortune's dearest spite | take all my comfort of thy worth and truth. | for whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit, | or any of these all, or all, or more | entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit, | i make my love engrafted to this store: | so then i am not lame, poor, nor despised, | whilst that this shadow doth such substance give, | that i in thy abundance am sufficed, | and by a part of all thy glory live: | look what is best, that best i wish in thee, | this wish i have, then ten times happy me. | 
how can my muse want subject to invent | while thou dost breathe that pour'st into my verse, | thine own sweet argument, too excellent, | for every vulgar paper to rehearse? | o give thy self the thanks if aught in me, | worthy perusal stand against thy sight, | for who's so dumb that cannot write to thee, | when thou thy self dost give invention light? | be thou the tenth muse, ten times more in worth | than those old nine which rhymers invocate, | and he that calls on thee, let him bring forth | eternal numbers to outlive long date. | if my slight muse do please these curious days, | the pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise. | 
o how thy worth with manners may i sing, | when thou art all the better part of me? | what can mine own praise to mine own self bring: | and what is't but mine own when i praise thee? | even for this, let us divided live, | and our dear love lose name of single one, | that by this separation i may give: | that due to thee which thou deserv'st alone: | o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove, | were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave, | to entertain the time with thoughts of love, | which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive. | and that thou teachest how to make one twain, | by praising him here who doth hence remain. | 
take all my loves, my love, yea take them all, | what hast thou then more than thou hadst before? | no love, my love, that thou mayst true love call, | all mine was thine, before thou hadst this more: | then if for my love, thou my love receivest, | i cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest, | but yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest | by wilful taste of what thy self refusest. | i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief | although thou steal thee all my poverty: | and yet love knows it is a greater grief | to bear greater wrong, than hate's known injury. | lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows, | kill me with spites yet we must not be foes. |
